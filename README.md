# Sketch Animator
A tool to pose and animate a 2d sketch.

WARNING: The computations involved are very intensive. Chrome seems to handle them best, but it will depend on your set up. I would suggest seeing how the simple fish example runs first before trying any more complicated sketches!

Follow the on-screen instructions to learn how the system works, then remove the tutorial and play around.
